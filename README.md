# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my attempt at coding the Frontend Mentor challenge, found here:
* https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29/hub

Things that could probably be better?
* How user uses the calculator
    * Maybe I want to continue using the value that has just been calculated
    * Maybe after every calculation, I start over again, like I pressed the reset button
    * A combination of both?
* JavaScript floating point values
    * For now, it's just set to have precision to 6 significant digits


## Overall, a fun experience

I didn't like my first attempt at this project, so I decided to redo the project from almost scratch. Some things I think I did better include:
* Creating the calculator as an object, which helped with some of the logic for creating calculator functions
* Learning Grid and Flexbox, then applying what I've learned to this project
* Attempt to reduce container clutter (divs, sections, forms?? ðŸ¤¯)

As always, I welcome all feedback.
